## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

### **Memory System**

```typescript
interface CharacterMemory {
  id: string;
  type: "conversation" | "event" | "relationship" | "emotion" | "decision";
  content: string;
  emotionalImpact: number;
  importance: number;
  timestamp: Date;
  associatedCharacters?: string[];
  context: string;
  tags: string[];
}
```

### **Consistency Analysis**

```typescript
interface CharacterConsistency {
  personalityTraits: Map<string, number>;
  behavioralPatterns: Map<string, number>;
  relationshipDynamics: Map<string, number>;
  emotionalResponses: Map<string, number>;
  lastUpdated: Date;
}
```

### **Relationship Dynamics**

```typescript
interface CharacterRelationship {
  id: string;
  characterA: string;
  characterB: string;
  relationshipType:
    | "friend"
    | "enemy"
    | "family"
    | "romantic"
    | "mentor"
    | "rival";
  strength: number;
  trust: number;
  intimacy: number;
  conflict: number;
  history: RelationshipEvent[];
  currentStatus:
    | "stable"
    | "growing"
    | "declining"

## ðŸ“Š **Usage Examples**

### **Starting a Development Session**

```typescript
// Start a personality development session
await startDevelopmentSession("personality");

// Generate deep insights
const insights = await advancedCharacterAI.deepenPersonality(characterId);

// Analyze relationships
const relationships = await characterRelationshipEngine.getAllRelationships(
  characterId
);
```

### **Character Response Generation**

```typescript
// Generate contextual character response
const response = await advancedCharacterAI.generateContextualResponse(
  characterId,
  userInput,
  context,
  emotionalState
);
```

### **Relationship Management**

```typescript
// Create a new relationship
const relationship = await characterRelationshipEngine.createRelationship(
  characterA,
  characterB,
  "friend"
);

// Simulate interaction
const event = await characterRelationshipEngine.simulateInteraction(
  characterA,
  characterB,
  "conversation",
  "discussing future plans"
);
```
