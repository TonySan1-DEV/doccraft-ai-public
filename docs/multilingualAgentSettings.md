## 2. Changing Agent Language

**From the Agent Chat UI:**
1. Open the DocCraft Agent chat window.
2. Click the 🌐 language dropdown in the chat header (top right).
3. Select your desired language (e.g., Español 🇪🇸).
4. The agent will immediately switch to your chosen language for all future messages.
5. You’ll see a confirmation message (e.g., “Idioma cambiado a Español”).

**From Account Settings:**
1. Go to your Account Settings.
2. Under “Preferences,” find the “Agent Language” dropdown.
3. Choose your preferred language and save.
4. The agent will use this language across all devices and sessions.

## 3. Enterprise-wide Settings

If your organization enforces a specific language, the Agent Language setting will be read-only and display a lock icon (🔒) with a message such as:

> “Language enforced by organization”

You will not be able to change the language unless your administrator allows it.

---

## 4. Fallback Behavior

If you select a language that is not supported, the agent will automatically switch to English and display a friendly fallback message:

> “Sorry, I don't speak this language yet. Switching back to English.”

All agent messages will then appear in English until you select a supported language.

## 5. Troubleshooting

- **Resetting Language:**
  - To reset your language, select “English” from the dropdown or clear your browser’s local storage for the site.
- **Missing or Incomplete Translations:**
  - If you notice untranslated or incomplete messages, the agent will display the original English text. Please contact support to report missing translations.
- **Language Not Changing:**
  - Ensure you are on a Pro or Admin plan. Free-tier users have access to English only.
  - If your organization enforces a language, you cannot change it yourself.
