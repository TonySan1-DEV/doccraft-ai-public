## ⚠️ **Pending: Database Schema**

The only remaining step is to apply the database schema:

### **Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project: `drqrjfkmgkyvdlqvfync`

2. **Navigate to SQL Editor**
   - Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
   - Click "New query"

3. **Apply the Schema**
   - Copy the entire contents of `database/apply-support-schema.sql`
   - Paste it into the SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" (or press Ctrl+Enter)

4. **Verify Tables Created**
   - Go to "Table Editor" in the left sidebar
   - You should see these new tables:
     - `support_tickets`
     - `ticket_messages`
     - `ticket_attachments`
     - `message_attachments`
     - `support_agents`
     - `chat_sessions`
     - `chat_messages`
     - `faq_items`
     - `support_preferences`

5. **Run Final Test**
   ```bash
   node scripts/test-support-system.cjs
   ```

## 🚀 **After Schema is Applied**

### **Test the Support System**

## 📊 **Current Test Results**

```
✅ PASS File Storage (1 files in storage)
✅ PASS Real-time Subscriptions (connection established)
✅ PASS Authentication (working correctly)
❌ FAIL Database Schema (tables not created yet)
❌ FAIL Support Agents (depends on schema)
❌ FAIL FAQ System (depends on schema)
```

**Overall: 3/6 tests passed** (3/3 infrastructure tests passed)

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Apply the database schema** (see instructions above)
2. **Run the final test**: `node scripts/test-support-system.cjs`
3. **Test in browser**: http://localhost:5179/support
4. **Create real support agent accounts** (optional)
5. **Customize FAQ content** (optional)
6. **Configure email notifications** (optional)

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### If Schema Application Fails:
- Check Supabase project permissions
- Verify SQL syntax in the schema file
- Try running individual SQL statements
- Check Supabase logs for errors

### If Tests Still Fail After Schema:
- Verify tables were created correctly
- Check RLS policies are applied
- Test database connection
- Review error messages in test output

### If Browser Tests Fail:
- Ensure dev server is running: `npm run dev`
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify authentication is working
- Test file upload functionality

## 🎉 **Success Criteria**

Once the schema is applied, you should see:
- ✅ All 6 tests passing
- ✅ Support page loading without errors
- ✅ Ticket creation working
- ✅ Live chat functional
