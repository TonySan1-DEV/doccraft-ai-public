trackAIError('character-ai', 'gpt-4', 'interaction', 'timeout');
updateCacheHitRate('character-ai', 0.92);

// Security Monitoring
trackSecurityThreat('brute-force', 'high', 'api');
updateSecurityThreatLevel(0.7);

// Business Metrics
trackUserEngagement('feature_used', 'pro', 'character_creation');
trackFeatureUsage('document_processor', 'pro', 'upload');
trackConversionEvent('upgrade', 'free', 'pro');
```

### Alerting Rules

```yaml
# Critical System Alerts
- alert: ServiceDown
  expr: up{job="doccraft-ai"} == 0
  for: 1m
  labels:
    severity: critical

# AI Service Performance
- alert: AIServiceHighLatency
  expr: histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(ai_latency_seconds_bucket[5m])) > 30
  for: 2m
  labels:
    severity: warning

# Business Impact
- alert: LowUserEngagement
  expr: rate(user_engagement_total[15m]) < 0.1
  for: 10m
  labels:
    severity: warning
```

### Dashboard Panels
