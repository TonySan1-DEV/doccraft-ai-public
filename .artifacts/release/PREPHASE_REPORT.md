## Notes / Next Actions

- ✅ All core readiness gates PASSED
- ⚠️ K8s validation skipped due to Docker unavailability (expected in Windows environment)
- ✅ Environment flags properly configured for staging (enabled) vs production (dormant)
- ✅ Monitoring infrastructure fully wired and functional
- ✅ Build process optimized with monitoring chunks under budget (6.25KB vs 25KB limit)
- 🚀 READY to proceed to P1 feature work (agentic upgrades & UI enhancements)
